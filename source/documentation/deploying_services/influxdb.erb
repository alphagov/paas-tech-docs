<h1 id="influxdb">InfluxDB (private beta)</h1>

[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is an open source time series database that allows you to store, index and search time series data.

<%= warning_text('InfluxDB is in private beta.') %>

To try InfluxDB, you must [contact support]() to [ask the GOV.UK PaaS team](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/support) to enable your access.

<h2 id="set-up-the-service">Set up the service</h2>

### Set up an InfluxDB service

1. Check whether you have access to InfluxDB by running:

    ```
    cf marketplace -s influxdb
    ```


    Here is an example of the output you will see:

    ```
    service plan   description                                                                            free or paid
    tiny-1.x       NOT Highly Available, 1 dedicated VM, 2 CPU per VM, 4GB RAM per VM, 16GB disk space.   paid
    ```


    Currently, there is only one plan available for InfluxDB: `tiny-1.x`.

    If the GOV.UK PaaS team has not enabled your access to InfluxDB, you’ll see:

    ```
    Service offering 'influxdb' not found.
    FAILED
    ```

2. Create a service instance:

    ```
    cf create-service influxdb tiny-1.x SERVICE_NAME
    ```


    where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this service instance. For example:

    ```
    cf create-service influxdb tiny-1.x my-influxdb-service
    ```

    It will take between 5 and 10 minutes to set up the service instance. To check its progress, run:

    ```
    cf service SERVICE_NAME
    ```

    for example:

    ```
    cf service my-influxdb-service
    ```

    When `cf service SERVICE_NAME` returns a `create succeeded` status, you have set up the service instance. An example output could be:

    ```
    name:            my-influxdb-service
    service:         influxdb
    tags:
    plan:            tiny-1.x
    description:     InfluxDB instances provisioned via Aiven
    documentation:
    dashboard:

    There are no bound apps for this service.

    Showing status of last operation from service my-influxdb-service...

    status:    create succeeded
    message:   Last operation succeeded

    ```

### Bind an InfluxDB service to your apps using an app manifest

You must bind your app to the InfluxDB service to access the InfluxDB database from your app.

1. Use the [app's manifest](/deploying_apps.html#deploying-public-apps) to bind the app to the service instance. It will bind automatically when you next deploy your app.

1. Deploy your app in line with your normal deployment process.

Refer to the [Cloud Foundry documentation on deploying with app manifests](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#services-block) for more information.

### Bind an InfluxDB service to your apps using cf bind-service

If your app does not have a manifest file, you can manually bind your service instance to your app.

1. Run the following:

    ```
    cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME
    ```


    where:
      - `APP_NAME` is the exact name of a deployed instance of your app
      - `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of the service instance you created

    For example:


    ```
    cf bind-service my-app my-influxdb-service
    ```

1. Deploy your app in line with your normal deployment process.

### Read and write data to InfluxDB

When you create an InfluxDB service instance, the service broker automatically creates a database called `defaultdb`.

`defaultdb` is the only database within the InfluxDB service instance you have permissions to use. If you try to read or write data to another database, you will get an error message.

When reading from and writing to InfluxDB you must specify the database as `defaultdb`.

If you’re using the [InfluxDB HTTP API](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api/) directly, you must specify the database using the `db` query parameter. For example, `db=defaultdb`.

If you’re using an [API client library](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api_client_libraries/), you must specify the database as `defaultdb` using your library's configuration.

### Using InfluxDB with Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is an open source tool for collecting metrics.

Prometheus is, by default, a stateful app that relies on local storage. You cannot run stateful apps using local storage on GOV.UK PaaS.

Without local storage, Prometheus metrics will not persist after the Prometheus [app restarts](/managing_apps.html#app-restarts). To store Prometheus metrics for longer, you configure Prometheus to send metrics to InfluxDB for storage.

1. Run Prometheus as an app on GOV.UK PaaS and [bind that app to an InfluxDB service instance](#bind-an-influxdb-service-to-your-apps).

1. the `prometheus.yml` configuration file, make sure the [`remote_read`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_read) and [`remote_write`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) sections match the same sections in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.

<h2 id="remove-the-service">Remove the service</h2>

### Unbind an InfluxDB service from your app

You must unbind the InfluxDB service before you can delete it:

```
cf unbind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME
```

where:

- `APP_NAME` is your app's deployed instance name as specified in your app's `manifest.yml` or push command
- `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this service instance

For example:

```
cf unbind-service my-app my-influxdb-service
```

If you unbind your service from your app but do not delete it, the service will persist even after you have deleted your app. You can re-bind or re-connect to it in future.

### Delete an InfluxDB service

Once you have unbound the InfluxDB service from your app, you can delete the service:

```
cf delete-service SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this service instance. For example:

```
cf delete-service my-influxdb-service
```

<%= warning_text('Deleting the InfluxDB service also deletes your InfluxDB data. This includes any backups that Aiven has taken.') %>

<h2 id="maintaining-the-service">Maintaining the service</h2>

### Data classification

You can store data classified up to Official on the GOV.UK PaaS. Refer to the [data security classification documentation](/deploying_services/#data-security-classification) for more information.

### InfluxDB backups

[Aiven](https://aiven.io) automatically backs up all data stored within any InfluxDB service you create.

Aiven takes backups every 12 hours and keeps 2 backups at a time.

To restore data to an earlier state, contact us at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).
