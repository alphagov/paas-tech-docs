# Amazon SQS

Amazon SQS provides "Standard" (at-least-once delivery, best-effort ordering) and First-In-First-Out queues.

### Provision an Amazon Web Service SQS queue

Creating a service instance provisions an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Queue
Service (SQS) queue.

The name of the service overall is `aws-sqs-queue`. There are two types of plan
available for the service named `standard` and `fifo`.

- `standard` plans configure queues that provide at-least-once delivery,
which means that each message is delivered at least once.
- `fifo` (first-in-first-out) plans configure queues that provide [exactly-once
processing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing),
which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a
consumer processes it and deletes it.

AWS SQS queues can be configured to move messages that can not be successfully
processed by your application on a secondary queue, known as a dead-letter
queue, letting you isolate problematic messages to determine why their
processing did not succeed.

#### Provision a standard AWS SQS queue

Use a Standard queue when the order of the items on your queue is not
important and when your application can tolerate occasional duplication of
messages.

Run the following in the command line to provision a Standard AWS SQS queue:

```
cf create-service aws-sqs-queue standard SERVICE_NAME
```

It will take between 1 and 5 minutes to set up the service instance. To check
its progress run:

```
cf service SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this SQS queue.

#### Provision a FIFO AWS SQS queue

Use a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue when the order of operations and events
is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated.

Run the following in the command line to provision a FIFO AWS SQS queue:

```
cf create-service aws-sqs-queue fifo SERVICE_NAME
```

It will take between 1 and 5 minuites to set up the service instance. To check
its progress run:

```
cf service SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this SQS queue.

### Bind an AWS SQS queue to your app

You must bind the SQS queue to your app so you can get credentials to use the
[AWS SQS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sqs/) to read
from and write to the queue.

You can bind an SQS queue using the command line or the manifest file.

Run the following to bind an SQS queue to your app:

```
cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME
```

It will take between 1 and 5 minutes to set up the binding. To check its progress, run:

```
cf service SERVICE_NAME
```

where:

- `APP_NAME` is the name of a deployed instance of your app, as specified in your app's manifest or push command
- `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this SQS queue

You can use the [app's manifest](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_apps.html#deploying-public-apps)
to bind an SQS queue to the app with default read and write permissions only.
It will bind automatically when you next deploy your app. An example manifest:

```
--
applications:
- name: APP_NAME
  services:
  - SERVICE_NAME
```

### Connect to an SQS queue from your app

Restart your app to populate your `VCAP_SERVICES` [environment variable](/deploying_apps.html#system-provided-environment-variables)
with the credentials needed to connect to the SQS queue.

An example `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable:

```
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "aws-sqs-queue": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    "credentials": {
     "aws_access_key_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "aws_region": "eu-west-2",
     "aws_secret_access_key": "XXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "primary_queue_url": "https://XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "secondary_queue_url": "https://XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    },
    "instance_name": "my-queue",
    "label": "aws-sqs-queue",
    "name": "my-queue",
    "plan": "standard",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "sqs"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
 }
}
```

You must pass credentials from your `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable to
your AWS software development kit (SDK). Use the appropriate [Amazon SDK
documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/#sdks), and extract the
credentials from VCAP_SERVICES to provide to the SDK. This can usually be done
either by setting AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION etc.
environment variables, or by providing the SDK with the right static credentials
function call or data as part of your app.

You should use the provided `primary_queue_url` in AWS API calls to make use of
the queue.

Your app may also connect to a second, separate, queue using the `secondary_queue_url`
value, however we recommend ignoring this value unless you are configuring a
dead-letter queue. See [configuring a dead letter queue][].

### Unbind an SQS queue from your app

Run the following in the command line to unbind the SQS queue from the app:

```
cf unbind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME
```

It can take between 1 and 5 minutes to remove the binding. To check its progress, run:

```
cf service SERVICE_NAME
```

where:

- `APP_NAME` is the name of a deployed instance of your app, as specified in your app's manifest or push command
- `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this SQS queue

If you unbind the SQS queue from your app but do not delete the queue, that
queue will persist even after you delete your app. You can re-bind or
re-connect to the queue in future.

### Updating an AWS SQS queue

#### Setting a message retention period

Messages that have not been consumed by your application will eventually expire
and be removed from the queue.

The default rention period is 4 days.
The maximum allowed retention period is 14days.

To configure the time that messages are kept on the queue we can update the
service, specifying the period in seconds:

```
cf update-service SERVICE_NAME -c '{"message_retention_period": 345600}'
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is the descriptive name for this SQS queue and `345600` is
a period in seconds to retain messages for. This parameter can also be passed at service creation time.

#### Configuring a dead-letter queue

Sometimes, your application may not be able to process a message from your
primary queue. When this happends it is useful to move messages onto a
secondary queue so they can investigated later without interfering with the
correct operation of your primary queue.

When your service is configured in this pattern we call the secondary queue a
"dead-letter" queue. To setup this pattern we can configure the number of times
a message is allowed to appear on the primary queue before it is redirected to
the secondary queue.

Run:

```
cf update-service SERVICE_NAME -c '{"redrive_max_receive_count": 3}'
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is the descriptive name for this SQS queue and `3` is the
number of attempts a message should have on the primary queue before being
redirected to the secondary queue. This parameter can also be passed at service creation time.

When you bind an app to an AWS SQS queue service instance, you will find credentials for two unique queue urls:

- `primary_queue_url` is the URL for the main queue
- `secondary_queue_url` is the URL for the secondary queue, now acting as a dead-letter queue

### Delete an SQS queue

Run the following in the command line to delete the SQS queue:

```
cf delete-service SERVICE_NAME
```

It can take between 1 and 5 minutes to delete the service instance. To check
its progress, run:

```
cf service SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this SQS queue.
