### Provision an Amazon Web Service S3 bucket

Creating a service instance provisions an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket.

The name of the service overall is `aws-s3-bucket`. There’s one type of plan available for the service named `default`. This plan has unlimited data, storage, and resources.

S3 buckets can be either private or public:

- private S3 buckets are only accessible using apps that you bind to that bucket
- files in public S3 buckets can be downloaded by anyone with the URL for those files

AWS encrypts S3 buckets using [Amazon S3-managed encryption keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html). You do not have to enable this encryption because it is enabled by default.

#### Provision a private AWS S3 bucket

Run the following in the command line to provision a private AWS S3 bucket:

```
cf create-service aws-s3-bucket default SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket.

#### Provision a public AWS S3 bucket

Public S3 buckets can be useful for tasks such as:

- storing static objects that you do not want to include with your app
- hosting `404` error pages that work independently of your app

Run the following in the command line to provision a public AWS S3 bucket:

```
cf create-service aws-s3-bucket default SERVICE_NAME -c '{"public_bucket":true}'
```
where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket.

### Bind an AWS S3 bucket to your app

You must bind the S3 bucket to your app so you can get credentials to use the [AWS S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/) to read from and write to the bucket.

You can bind an S3 bucket using the command line or the manifest file. You must use the command line when you want to specify permissions for the bucket.

Run the following to bind the S3 bucket to your app:

```
cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME -c '{"permissions": "PERMISSION"}'
```

where:

- `APP_NAME` is the name of a deployed instance of your app, as specified in your app's manifest or push command
- `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket
- `PERMISSION` is the permission level and can be either `read-write` or `read-only`

You can use the [app's manifest](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_apps.html#deploying-public-apps) to bind an S3 bucket to the app with default read and write permissions only. It will bind automatically when you next deploy your app. An example manifest:

```
--
applications:
- name: APP_NAME
  services:
  - SERVICE_NAME
```

By default, you can only [connect to an S3 bucket from your GOV.UK PaaS-hosted app](#connect-to-an-s3-bucket-from-your-app).

To [connect to an S3 bucket from outside the GOV.UK PaaS](#connect-to-an-s3-bucket-from-outside-of-the-gov-uk-paas), you must create a service key.  

### Connect to an S3 bucket from your app

Restart your app to populate your `VCAP_SERVICES` [environment variable](/deploying_apps.html#system-provided-environment-variables) with the credentials needed to connect to the S3 bucket.

An example `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable:

```
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "aws-s3-bucket": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    "credentials": {
     "aws_access_key_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "aws_region": "eu-west-2",
     "aws_secret_access_key": "XXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "bucket_name": "paas-s3-broker-prod-lon-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "deploy_env": ""
    },
    "instance_name": "my-bucket",
    "label": "aws-s3-bucket",
    "name": "my-bucket",
    "plan": "default",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "s3"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
 }
}
```
You must pass credentials from your `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable to your AWS software development kit (SDK). Use the appropriate [Amazon SDK documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/#sdks) to do this.  

### Connect to an S3 bucket from outside of the GOV.UK PaaS

To connect to an S3 bucket from outside of the GOV.UK PaaS, you must create a service key and credentials that allow external access to the bucket.

1. Create a service key and credentials to allow external access:

    ```
    cf create-service-key SERVICE_NAME SERVICE_KEY -c '{"allow_external_access": true}'
    ```
    where:
    - `SERVICE_NAME` is the unique descriptive name for the S3 bucket
    - `SERVICE_KEY` is a unique descriptive name for the service key

1. Get the service key credentials:

    ```
    cf service-key SERVICE_NAME SERVICE_KEY
    ```

    You will see output similar to the following:

    ```
    {
     "aws_access_key_id": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY",
     "aws_region": "AWS_REGION",
     "aws_secret_access_key": "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
     "bucket_name": "BUCKET_NAME",
     "deploy_env": ""
    }
    ```

    Use these credentials to connect to the S3 bucket from outside of the GOV.UK PaaS.

#### Listing and revoking service keys

You can list all service keys for a service by running the following:

```
cf service-keys SERVICE_NAME
```

These credentials persist and do not get automatically deleted when you sign out of the GOV.UK PaaS. If you do not need these credentials, you should delete them by running:

```
cf delete-service-key MY_SERVICE MY_KEY
```

<h2 id="use-the-service">Use the service</h2>

You can take different actions on an S3 bucket using the [AWS S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/). The actions you can take depend on your permission level for that bucket.

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

|Description|Command|Permission|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Download an object from S3 bucket|`s3:GetObject`|`read-write`, `read-only`|
|Upload an object to S3 bucket|`s3:PutObject`|`read-write`|
|Delete an object from S3 bucket|`s3:DeleteObject`|`read-write`|
|Get AWS region of S3 bucket|`s3:GetBucketLocation`|`read-write`, `read-only`|
|List objects in S3 bucket|`s3:ListBucket`|`read-write`, `read-only`|

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

<h2 id="remove-the-service">Remove the service</h2>

### Unbind an S3 bucket from your app

Run the following in the command line to unbind the S3 bucket from the app:

```
cf unbind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME
```

where:

- `APP_NAME` is the name of a deployed instance of your app, as specified in your app's manifest or push command
- `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket

If you unbind the S3 bucket from your app but do not delete the bucket, that bucket will persist even after you delete your app. You can re-bind or re-connect to the bucket in future.

### Delete an S3 bucket

You must delete all objects from the S3 bucket before you can delete the bucket itself.

You must have read and write permissions for an S3 bucket to delete objects from that bucket.

Use the [AWS S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/) to delete objects from the bucket.

Run the following in the command line to delete the S3 bucket:

```
cf delete-service SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket.
