# User-provided services

Cloud Foundry enables tenants to define their own external services that are not available in the marketplace by using a [user-provided service instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html)s. They can be used to deliver service credentials to an application, and/or to trigger streaming of application logs to a syslog compatible consumer. Once created, user-provided service instances behave like service instances created through the marketplace.

If you need a particular backing service that we don't yet support, please let us know at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).
