# User-provided backing services

You can use backing services that are not available in the Cloud Foundry marketplace by using a [user-provided service instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html). 

User-provided backing service instances have the same functionality as backing service instances available in the marketplace.

If you need a particular backing service that we do not support, contact us at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).
