# GOV.UK Platform as a Service

GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud hosting platform built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). GOV.UK PaaS manages the deployment of your apps, services, and background tasks so you do not need to hire people with specialist cloud skills.

GOV.UK PaaS is hosted in two regions: London and Ireland.

GOV.UK PaaS uses the open source [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) project and runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

GOV.UK PaaS is a live service. However, we are decommissioning the service, with a planned retirement date of 23 December 2023. You can [read our blog post announcement](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2022/07/12/why-weve-decided-to-decommission-gov-uk-paas-platform-as-a-service/).

To understand how you can prepare to migrate your services and how the GOV.UK PaaS team can help, read our [migration guidance](https://cloud.service.gov.uk/migration-guidance).
