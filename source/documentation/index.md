# GOV.UK Platform as a Service

GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud-hosting platform built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). GOV.UK PaaS manages the deployment of your apps, services and background tasks so you don’t need to hire people with specialist cloud skills.

The GOV.UK PaaS is hosted in two locations, London and Ireland. 

GOV.UK PaaS is currently in private beta.

GOV.UK PaaS uses the open source [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) [external link] project, and runs on Amazon Web Services. [Read our blog post](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/17/choosing-cloudfoundry/) [external link] for more information on why we chose Cloud Foundry. Refer to the [features page](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/features) for more information on GOV.UK PaaS.
