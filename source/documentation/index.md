# GOV.UK Platform as a Service

GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud-hosting platform built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). GOV.UK PaaS manages the deployment of your apps, services and background tasks so you donâ€™t need to hire people with specialist cloud skills.

The GOV.UK PaaS is hosted in two regions, London and Ireland.

GOV.UK PaaS is a live service, however it is being decommissioned by Dec 22nd 2023. You can [read our blog post announcement](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2022/07/12/why-weve-decided-to-decommission-gov-uk-paas-platform-as-a-service/).

GOV.UK PaaS uses the open source [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) project, and runs on Amazon Web Services.
