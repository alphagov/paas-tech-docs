## Penetration testing

[It is your responsibility](#responsibility-model) to penetration test your app to make sure it’s secure. Note that you can only penetration test your app; you cannot penetration test the platform.

You must send the below information to [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) so that we are aware of your penetration test and can approve it.
