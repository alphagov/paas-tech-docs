# Get started

## Get an account

Your department, agency or team must have a GOV.UK PaaS account. This account is called an organisation, or [org](/orgs_spaces_users.html#organisations). Sign up for an org account at [https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/signup](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/signup).

Once your department, agency or team has an org account, you will need a personal account. Ask your [org manager](/orgs_spaces_users.html#org-manager) to authorise the creation of your personal account.

The GOV.UK PaaS is hosted in 2 independent regions, London and Ireland.

By default, the GOV.UK PaaS team creates new accounts in the London region unless you request otherwise during sign up.

To provide you with an account, we need to store some personal data about you. Please see our [privacy notice](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/privacy-notice) for details.

Once you have a personal account, you can access the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool for either the [London](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or the [Ireland](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/) region (requires sign in). This tool allows you to view and manage your [orgs](/orgs_spaces_users.html#organisations), [spaces](/orgs_spaces_users.html#spaces) and [users](/orgs_spaces_users.html#users-and-user-roles) without using the command line. Your level of access depends on your user role permissions.

Contact us by emailing [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) if you have any questions.

## Set up the Cloud Foundry command line

GOV.UK PaaS is hosted on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) [external link]. You must use the Cloud Foundry command line interface (CLI) to manage your apps hosted on the GOV.UK PaaS. To set it up:

1. Download and install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) for your platform.

2. To check that it is installed correctly, run `cf -v` in the command line.

    If it has installed correctly, you will receive the `cf version X.X.Xâ€¦` confirmation message.

Depending on your network configuration, you might need to set an `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable for the CLI to connect. Contact your network administrator for your configuration settings.

Refer to the Cloud Foundry documentation on [using the Cloud Foundry CLI with a proxy server](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/http-proxy.html) for more information.

## Sign in to Cloud Foundry

You can sign in to Cloud Foundry using either your [GOV.UK PaaS account information](get_started.html#get-an-account) or the single sign-on function.

### Use your GOV.UK PaaS account

The default method to sign in to Cloud Foundry is to use your [GOV.UK PaaS account](get_started.html#get-an-account) information.

1. If your org is hosted in London, run the following in the command line:

    ```
    cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk -u USERNAME
    ```

    If your org is hosted in Ireland, run:

    ```
    cf login -a api.cloud.service.gov.uk -u USERNAME
    ```

    `USERNAME` is your personal GOV.UK PaaS account email address.

1. Enter your GOV.UK PaaS account password.

When you have signed in, run `cf` in the command line to see all available commands.

### Use single sign-on 

You can sign in to Cloud Foundry using the single sign-on function. 

Using single sign-on makes managing your security, joining and leaving processes simpler by reducing the number of passwords or accounts you have to manage.

You must have either a [Google](https://myaccount.google.com/intro) or [Microsoft](https://account.microsoft.com/account) email address to use single sign-on. The email address must be the same as the one you use to sign into your GOV.UK PaaS account.

#### Enable single sign-on

1. Sign into the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool for [London](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or [Ireland](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/). 

1. Select __Set up Google/Microsoft single sign-on__ and then select __Activate Google/Microsoft single sign-on__.

1. Get a URL to generate a temporary authentication code. If your org is hosted in [London](orgs_spaces_users.html#regions), run the following in the command line:

    ```
    cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso
    ```

    If your org is hosted in [Ireland](orgs_spaces_users.html#regions), run:

    ```
    cf login -a api.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso
    ```

1. Go to the URL and select __Continue__ under either __Google__ or __Microsoft__.

1. On the __Sign in__ page, enter or select your email address.

1. Enter your password and, if applicable, the 2-step verification code to generate a temporary authentication code.

1. Copy the generated temporary authentication code into the command line.

When you have signed in, you will see code similar to the following:

```
API endpoint:   https://api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk (API version: 2.136.0)
User:           john.smith@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
Org:            hmrc-prod
Space:          sandbox

```


## Deploy a test static HTML page

You can practice deploying an app by deploying a test static HTML page.

1. To deploy an app, you must select a [target](deploying_apps.html#set-a-target). This is a combination of an [organisation](/orgs_spaces_users.html#organisations) and a [space](/orgs_spaces_users.html#spaces).

    All orgs have a sandbox space for you to use when learning about the PaaS. When deploying a test static HTML page, you should target this sandbox space by running:

    ```
    cf target -o ORGNAME -s sandbox
    ```

    where `ORGNAME` is your org and `sandbox` is the name of the sandbox space.

    If you deploy an app using the same name and target as an existing app, the original will be replaced. If you are not sure about where to deploy your app, consult the rest of your team or speak to the PaaS team by emailing [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

2. In an empty directory, create an `index.html` file containing the following markup:.

    ```
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Static Site</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>Welcome to the static site!</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. Create a `manifest.yml` file in the same directory as the `index.html` file. The manifest file tells Cloud Foundry what to do with your app.

    ```
    ---
    applications:
    - name: APPNAME
      memory: 64M
      buildpack: staticfile_buildpack
    ```

    where `APPNAME` is the unique name for your app. You can run `cf apps` to see apps which already exist.

    The `memory` line tells the PaaS how much memory to allocate to the app.

    A buildpack provides app framework and runtime support. For example, if your app was written in Ruby, you would use the `ruby_buildpack`. In this example, we use the `staticfile_buildpack` for the static HTML page.

4. In the directory where you created the files, run `cf push APPNAME` to push the static HTML page to the GOV.UK PaaS.

    If you do not specify the app name in `cf push`, the name specified in the manifest file is used.

    The static HTML page is now available at your [app domain](/orgs_spaces_users.html#regions).

For a production app, you should read the [production checklist](deploying_apps.html#production-checklist).
