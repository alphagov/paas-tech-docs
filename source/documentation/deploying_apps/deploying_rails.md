## Deploy a Ruby on Rails app


This section explains minimal steps for deploying a basic Rails app. For full details of how to deploy Ruby on Rails apps, see the official Cloud Foundry guide [Getting Started Deploying Ruby on Rails Apps](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/ruby/gsg-ror.html) [external link]. 


These steps assume you have already carried out the setup process explained in the [Quick Setup Guide](/#quick-setup-guide) section.

When you deploy an app, you must select a combination of an organisation and a space (see [Orgs and spaces](/#organisations-spaces-amp-targets) for more information). This is called the **target**.

We have provided a ``sandbox`` space for you to use for learning about the PaaS. You may want to target the sandbox while you are testing by running:

``cf target -s sandbox``

It's also important to realise that if you deploy an app using the same name and target as an existing app, the original will be replaced. If you are not sure about where to deploy your app, consult the rest of your team.

###Deploying a non-database app

This is how to deploy a Rails app that doesn't require a database.

1. Put the code for your Rails app into a local directory (for example, by checking it out of version control).

1. [Exclude files ignored by Git](/#excluding-files).

1. If you're using Rails 4, [add the `rails_12factor` gem](https://github.com/heroku/rails_12factor#install) for better logging. Rails 5 has this functionality built in by default.

1. Create a manifest.yml file in the folder where you checked out your app.

        ---
        applications:
        - name: my-rails-app
          memory: 256M
          buildpack: ruby_buildpack

    Replace ``my-rails-app`` with a unique name for your app. (You can use ``cf apps`` to see apps which already exist).

    The `memory` line tells the PaaS how much memory to allocate to the app.

    A buildpack provides any framework and runtime support required by an app. In this case, because the app is written in Ruby, you use the ``ruby_buildpack``.

1. Upload and start the application by running:

    ```
    cf push APPNAME
    ```

    from the directory which contains all the code and configuration files for your app.

    If you do not specify a name for the app after the ``cf push`` command, the name from the manifest file is used.

1. Set any additional [environment variables](/#environment-variables) required by your app. For example:

    ```
    cf set-env APPNAME VARIABLE `value`
    ```

    where VARIABLE is a unique name for the variable, and `value` is the value to set.

Your app should now be live at `https://APPNAME.cloudapps.digital`!

For a production service, you should run at least two instances of the app to ensure availability.

You can add another instance of your app by running:

``cf scale APPNAME -i 2``

###Deploying with a database

Note that the PaaS currently supports the PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB database services. If your Rails app requires a database, it must be able to work with one of these.

 The Cloud Foundry buildpack for Ruby automatically gets the details of the first available PostgreSQL service from the ``VCAP_SERVICES`` environment variable and sets the Ruby `DATABASE_URL` environment variable accordingly. Ensure that your app is configured to use `DATABASE_URL` to set its database configuration when deployed to the PaaS.

1. Put the code for your Rails app into a local directory (for example, by checking it out of version control).

1. If you are using Git, you may wish to [exclude files ignored by Git](/#excluding-files).

1. If you're using Rails 4, [add the `rails_12factor` gem](https://github.com/heroku/rails_12factor#install) for better logging. Rails 5 has this functionality built in by default.

1. Create a manifest.yml file in the directory where you checked out your app.

        ---
        applications:
        - name: my-rails-app
          memory: 256M
          buildpack: ruby_buildpack

    Replace ``my-rails-app`` with a unique name for your app. (You can use ``cf apps`` to see apps which already exist).

    The `memory` line tells the PaaS how much memory to allocate to the app.

    A buildpack provides any framework and runtime support required by an app. In this case, because the app is written in Ruby, you use the ``ruby_buildpack``.


1. Upload the app without starting it using this command:

    ```
    cf push --no-start APPNAME
    ```

    from the directory which contains all the code and configuration files for your app.

    If you do not specify a name for the app after the ``cf push`` command, the name from the manifest file is used.


1. Set any additional [environment variables](/#environment-variables) required by your app. For example:

    ```
    cf set-env APPNAME VARIABLE `value`
    ```

    where VARIABLE is a unique name for the variable, and `value` is the value to set.


1. [Create a PostgreSQL backing service (if required) and bind it to your app](/#using-postgresql).

    To enable Rails support for database migrations, you may wish to create a `Procfile` in the same directory as your `manifest.yml` and `Gemfile`. The `Procfile` is a way to specify commands to be run when deploying your app.

    This is a minimal example of the `Procfile` content for *Rails 5.0*:

    ```
    web: rake db:migrate && bin/rails server
    ```

1. Start your app by running: 

    ```
    cf start APPNAME
    ```

Your app should now be live at `https://APPNAME.cloudapps.digital`!

For a production service, you should run at least two instances of the app to ensure availability.

You can add another instance of your app by running:

``cf scale APPNAME -i 2``

### Web servers

By default, the Cloud Foundry Ruby buildpack [runs `bin/rails server`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/blob/1f0ac3ce10866390d161c3f27e71d64890859454/lib/language_pack/rails4.rb#L27) 
to spin up the application. In Rails 4 and below, this will use WEBrick as the web
server. In Rails 5 and above, the default is
[puma](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#starting-up-the-web-server).

You may want to use a different web server in production. See the Cloud Foundry docs for
[more information on configuring a production server](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/prod-server.html) [external link].


### Troubleshooting asset precompilation

By default, the Rails buildpack performs asset precompilation during the staging phase. This is fine for
most Rails apps, but it won't work for those which need to connect to services (such as the database)
during asset compilation. (For an example, see [MyUSA issue #636](https://github.com/18F/myusa/issues/636))

There are multiple potential solutions for this. For more advice, see
[the Cloud Foundry document on the subject](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/ruby/ruby-tips.html#precompile) [external link].
