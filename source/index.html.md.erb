# GOV.UK Platform-as-a-Service

## Bring your own metrics

GOV.UK PaaS offers out of the box metrics and logging which are available using
the [web user interface](https://admin.tlwr.dev.cloudpipeline.digital).

The metrics and logging solutions provided as a service by GOV.UK PaaS do not
cover all use cases, for instance custom application metrics, or service
specific alerting.

This tutorial will show you how to deploy a monitoring and logging stack to the
GOV.UK PaaS, using the following open source tools:

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Alertmanager
- InfluxDB
- Fluent Bit

### Technology overview

#### Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is monitoring system which describes itself
as:

> Prometheus, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project, is a systems and
service monitoring system. It collects metrics from configured targets at given
intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger
alerts if some condition is observed to be true.

Prometheus is responsible for collecting application container metrics and
backing service metrics exposed by GOV.UK PaaS, and custom application metrics
exposed by your application.

Prometheus is also responsible for triggering alerts when certain criteria are
met. For more information about Prometheus, please refer to [the Prometheus
documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/).

#### Alertmanager

Alertmanager is a tool for receiving alerts raised by Prometheus and routing
them to the correct destination, based on a configurable set of rules. Alert
destinations could be a on-call response paging system, or a ticketing system's
queue.

For more information please refer to [the Alertmanager
documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/).

#### Grafana

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana) is a visualisation tool which describes itself as:

> Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics
no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with
your team and foster a data driven culture.

Grafana is the interface through which you will be able to query and explore
your metrics and logs.

For more information please refer to [the Grafana
documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/).

#### InfluxDB

InfluxDB is an open source time-series database that is available through the
GOV.UK PaaS marketplace, and hosted by our service provider
[Aiven.io](https://www.aiven.io).

InfluxDB describes itself as:

> InfluxDB is a time series database designed to handle high write and query
loads.  It is designed to handle high write and query loads and provides a
SQL-like query language called InfluxQL for interacting with data.

For more information please refer to [the InfluxDB
documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/).

#### Fluent Bit

Fluent Bit describes itself as:

> an open source and multi-platform Log Processor and Forwarder which allows
you to collect data/logs from different sources, unify and send them to
multiple destinations. It's fully compatible with Docker and Kubernetes
environments.

Fluent Bit is responsible for sending application logs to InfluxDB, so your
logs and metrics are stored in the same place, and queryable in the same way.

### Architecture

_An image showing the architecture of an observability stack
hosted on GOV.UK PaaS_

Prometheus will be an application hosted directly on GOV.UK PaaS. It will be
configured as a stateless application, and it will delegate the long-term
storage of metrics to InfluxDB. Prometheus will send any alerts that are fired
to Alertmanager.

Alertmanager is responsible for sending the alert to the configured
destination, and is also an application hosted on GOV.UK PaaS.

Grafana is configured to query Prometheus and InfluxDB. It can query Prometheus
for metrics using PromQL, the Prometheus query language. It can also query
InfluxDB using PromQL, or InfluxQL, depending on your query language
preference. Grafana also queries InfluxDB directly in order to fetch and
visualise logs.

### Deploying the stack

#### Create the GOV.UK PaaS space

In order to keep things organised we will create a separate space where our
monitoring stack will live. This simplifies operations, and billing.

Create a space using the CF CLI:

```
cf create-space monitoring
```

#### Provision InfluxDB

InfluxDB is available through the GOV.UK PaaS marketplace, as supplied by
[aiven.io](https://aiven.io).

For pricing details please see [the pricing
calculator](https://admin.tlwr.dev.cloudpipeline.digital/calculator).

Provision an InfluxDB instance using the CF CLI:

```
cf create-service influxdb small observe-db
```

#### Deploy Alertmanager

Alertmanager will be deployed as a GOV.UK PaaS application, using the following
application manifest:

```
# manifest.yml
applications:
  - name: alertmanager
    buildpacks:
      - alertmanager_buildpack
```

When pushing the Alertmanager as an application, you can also configure it by
putting configuration in a file called `alertmanager.yml` that is in the same
directly as `manifest.yml` when pushing the application. The following is an
example configuration file:

```
# alertmanager.yml
global:
  slack_api_url: 'https://slack.com/webhook-secret-goes-here'

route:
  group_by: ['alertname', 'cluster', 'service']
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 3h 

- source_match:
    severity: 'critical'
  target_match:
    severity: 'warning'


receivers:
- name: 'operations-slack'
  slack_config:
  - to: 'team-X+alerts@example.org'
    icon_emoji: ':fire:'
    text: everything is :fine:
    channel: #operations
```

Once deployed, Alertmanager will be reachable on
[https://alertmanager.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital](https://alertmanager.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital).

Deploy Alertmanager:

```
$ pwd
/tmp/example/alertmanager
$ ls .
manifest.yml alertmanager.yml
$ cf push
...
$ echo done
```

#### Deploy Prometheus

Prometheus will be deployed as a GOV.UK PaaS application, using the following
application manifest:

```
# manifest.yml
applications:
  - name: prometheus

    buildpacks:
      - prometheus_buildpack

    services:
      - observe-db
```

Like Alertmanager, Prometheus can be configured using a configuration file
colocated with the application manifest called `prometheus.yml`. The following
is an example configuration file, which assumes you have deployed the [paas-prometheus-exporter](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/monitoring_apps.html#metrics) on [https://paas-exporter.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital](https://paas-exporter.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital).

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 10s

scrape_configs:
- job_name: paas-exporter
  scheme: https
  static_configs:
    - targets: [paas-exporter.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineappsapps.digital]

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    static_configs:
    - targets: [alertmanager.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineappsapps.digital]
```

The Prometheus buildpack looks at the services to which the app is bound, and
automatically adds the necessary `remote_read` and `remote_write` configuration
needed to persist Prometheus metrics in InfluxDB.

The Prometheus buildpack can also be pushed with an `alerts.yml` file which configures alerts registered in Prometheus.

Once deployed, Prometheus will be reachable on
[https://prometheus.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital](https://prometheus.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital).

Deploy Prometheus:

```
$ pwd
/tmp/example/prometheus
$ ls .
manifest.yml prometheus.yml
$ cf push
...
$ echo done
```

#### Deploy Grafana

Grafana will be deployed as a GOV.UK PaaS application, using the following
application manifest:

```
# manifest.yml
applications:
  - name: grafana

    buildpacks:
      - grafana_buildpack

    services:
      - observe-db
      - my-amazon-s3-bucket

    env:
      PROMETHEUS_URLS: https://prometheus.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital
      ROOT_URL: https://grafana.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital
```

Deploy Grafana:

```
$ pwd
/tmp/example/grafana
$ ls .
manifest.yml config.ini
$ cf push
...
$ echo done
```

The Grafana buildpack looks at the services to which the app is bound, and
automatically adds any InfluxDB, or Elasticsearch services as Grafana
datasources.

The Grafana buildpack can configure Grafana to be made stateful using a bound
Postgres service.

The Grafana buildpack can configure Grafana to use a bound public S3 bucket for
image storage.


Like Alertmanager and Prometheus, Grafana can be configured using a
configuration file colocated with the application manifest called
`grafana.init`. The configuration file can interpolate environment variables
using `{{ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME}} syntax.

An example `config.ini` is as follows:

```
[server]
http_port = {{PORT}}
protocol = https
root_url = {{ROOT_URL}}
```

Once deployed, Grafana will be reachable on
[https://grafana.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital](https://grafana.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital).

Deploy Grafana:

```
$ pwd
/tmp/example/grafana
$ ls .
manifest.yml config.ini
$ cf push
...
$ echo done
```

#### Deploy Fluent Bit

Fluent Bit is deployed as a sidecar process to your application, this means you
will have another process running in every application container, which will
ship logs to InfluxDB.

In order to achieve this, you must modify your existing application manifest.

If you had the following manifest for deploying a ruby application:

```
applications:
  - name: my-ruby-app

    buildpacks:
      - ruby_buildpack

    services:
      - app-db
```

You would:

- Add `fluentbit_buildpack` to the list of buildpacks, it must not be last
- Add the `observe-db` created earlier to the services section
- Add a sidecars section which starts Fluent Bit on application launch

```
applications:
  - name: my-ruby-app

    buildpacks:
      - fluentbit_buildpack
      - ruby_buildpack

    services:
      - app-db
      - observe-db

    sidecars:
      - name: config-server
        command: './fluent-bit-buildpack-launcher'
        process_types:
          - web
```

Once your application is redeployed, your logs will be forwarded to your
InfluxDB database, and will be queryable in Grafana in the Explore pane:
[https://grafana.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital/explore](https://grafana.tlwr.dev.cloudpipelineapps.digital/explore).

## High availability

The best way to make this monitoring stack highly available is to have:

- Two separate InfluxDB services
- Two separate Prometheis applications bound to separate InfluxDB instances
- Two Grafanas bound to BOTH Prometheis and InfluxDB instances
- Three Alertmanager's in a mesh

More information about high availability can be found in a follow up tutorial.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you've set up a monitoring stack using Prometheus,
Alertmanager, Grafana, InfluxDB, and Fluent Bit. You've reconfigured your to
application forward logs to InfluxDB which you can query in Grafana. You've
configured Prometheus to collect metrics from GOV.UK PaaS, and forward them to
InfluxDB, which you can query in Grafana.
